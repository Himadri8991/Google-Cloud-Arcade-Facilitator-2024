* `Training a machine learning model to predict a search result ranking.`

* Using a reinforcement learning algorithm to train autonomous drones for package delivery.

* Implementing AI to develop a new product or service that has never been seen before.

* Using AI to replace a human decision-maker in complex situations, such as those involving life-or-death choices.

  
### 3. Which use case demonstrates ML’s ability to process natural language?

* Segmenting images into different parts or regions to extract information, such as the text on a sign.

* Detecting people and objects in surveillance footage to use as evidence in criminal cases.

* Identifying the artist, title, or genre of a song to create playlists based on the user's listening habits.

* `Identifying the topic and sentiment of customer email messages so that they can be routed to the relevant department.`

  
### 4. You’re watching a video on YouTube and are shown a list of videos that YouTube thinks you are interested in. What ML solution powers this feature?

* Video transcription

* Content moderation

* `Personalized recommendations`

* Clickbait detection

  
### 5. Google applies generative AI to products like Google Workspace, but what is generative AI?

* A type of artificial intelligence that can create and sustain its own consciousness.

* A type of artificial intelligence that can understand and respond to human emotions.

* A type of artificial intelligence that can make decisions and take actions.

* `A type of artificial intelligence that can produce new content, including text, images, audio, and synthetic data.`

  
### 6. Which technology relies on models to analyze large amounts of data, learn from the insights, and then make predictions and informed decisions?

* Natural language processing

* Expert systems

* `Machine learning`

* Robotics

  
### 7. Which dimension for measuring data quality means that the data conforms to a set of predefined standards and definitions such as type and format?

* `Validity`

* Consistency

* Accuracy

* Uniqueness

  
### 8. Which option refers to the use of technologies to build machines and computers that can mimic cognitive functions associated with human intelligence?

* Natural language processing

* Machine learning

* Deep learning

* `Artificial intelligence`

  
### 9. How do data analytics and business intelligence differ from AI and ML?

* `Data analytics and business intelligence identify trends from historical data, whereas AI and ML use data to make decisions for future business.`

* Data analytics and business intelligence use automated decision-making processes, whereas AI and ML require human intervention and interpretation of data.

* Data analytics and business intelligence involve advanced algorithms for predicting future trends, whereas AI and ML focus on processing historical data.

* Data analytics and business intelligence are used only in small businesses, whereas AI and ML are used exclusively by large corporations.

  
### 10. What does the consistency dimension refer to when data quality is being measured?

* `Whether the data is uniform and doesn’t contain any contradictory information.`

* Whether a dataset is free from duplicate values that could prevent an ML model from learning accurately.

* Whether all the required information is present.

* Whether the data is up-to-date and reflects the current state of the phenomenon that is being modeled.
